//Map Object

/*
 - Used for simple key/value pairs
 - Any value can be used for either a key or value
   (i.e object , string, function)
 - Reasons for using Map over Object:
   -- Object prototyá¹•e has default keys that might conflict with
   own keys
   -- Keys of map can be anything, where as with objects,have to be
   string of symbol
   -- Can  easily get the size of Map
